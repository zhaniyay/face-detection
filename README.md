## Real-Time Face Detection
 
 A real-time face detection system built using Detectron2, Faster R-CNN, and OpenCV for high-accuracy face recognition.

 This project utilizes Detectron2's Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50 + FPN) model for real-time face detection. It supports custom datasets formatted in COCO format, allowing efficient training and inference. The system integrates OpenCV for webcam-based detection.
